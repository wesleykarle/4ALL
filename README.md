# Name
<b>4ALL</b>

# Description
4ALL is a vision of mine that would create a new, easier alternative to locate and sign up for volunteering opportunities in your local community and beyond. Users and Organizations will be able to easily connect on a social media backed framework solely intended to serve others. Users will be able to track their community service hours and build their profiles to use for a multitude of reasons including Academically, Professionally, and Spiritually.
